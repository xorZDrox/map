### A collaborative map for reporting problems on the road

*Because coding together is better than coding alone (TM)*

##### [The Map](report.geojson)

CC-BY-SA

##### How to contribute

1. Fork the project
2. Add or edit a location by editing and following the format in `report.geojson` (hint, it's geoJSON)
3. Submit a pull request

##### Validating the geoJSON

When you submit a pull request, it will automatically check to ensure your geoJSON is valid.

If you'd like to check yourself, pasting the contents of `report.geojson` into http://geojsonlint.com.

##### how to put report in the map.
I use this editor, `geojson.io` and copy the gejson formt result in the fork file.
